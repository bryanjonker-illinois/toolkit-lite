# The contents of the toolkit

[The component library](./components/README.md) is a collection of pre-built elements for creating branded web pages. It includes the official campus header and footer, and specialized components for describing and arranging page content.

The [toolkit stylesheet](./css/README.md) contains a wide number of variables that make it easy to use the official campus colors, typefaces, and icons online.
