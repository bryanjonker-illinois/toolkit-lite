    <h1>Collecting rocks and minerals</h1>

    <p>Two keys, one for minerals and one for rocks, briefly present
      clues that may aid the collector in identifying rocks and minerals found
      in Illinois. In outline form, the keys are a guide to some of the easily
      observable properties that various rocks and minerals display.</p>

    <h2>Equipment for collecting</h2>

    <p>All specimens should be labeled with the following information: name of mineral or rock type, where found, collector’s name, and date. As your collection grows, you may want to set up a system of cataloging. List specimens and assign a number to each one. Place a small amount of white enamel on a corner of each specimen; when the enamel dries, number the sample with India ink; coat number with lacquer. Corresponding numbers should be entered on your list of specimens.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Hammer (bricklayer’s) with one chisel or pick head.
      <li>Cold chisel about 6 inches long with an edge about ½-inch wide.
      <li>Dilute hydrochloric (muriatic) acid (10 percent solution) in a dropper bottle for testing the presence of carbonate minerals. Mark the bottle POISON. If acid is spilled on skin or clothing, wipe immediately and, if possible, rinse with water.
      <li>Magnifying glass or hand lens—10 power is probably most useful.
      <li>Hardness testers—penny, square of window glass, pocket knife, or nail.
      <li>Streak plate—piece of unglazed white porcelain (such as the back of a tile) for testing the color of the streak of minerals.
      <li>Notebook and pencil for keeping records of the locality and bed from which specimens are collected.
      <li>Collecting bag—a musette bag, a knapsack, or similar bag of strong material.
      <li>Heavy gloves and goggles to protect hands and eyes.
      <li>Labels and wrappings. Field identification of specimens may be written on adhesive tape and attached to the specimen or on a slip of paper enclosed in the wrapping. Newspaper, brown paper, or paper bags can be used for wrapping specimens. Label the outside of the wrapped specimen too. Take only the best specimens home with you. Trim specimens to hand size (about 2 by 3 inches).
    </ol>


    <h2>Keys for identification of common rocks and minerals</h2>

    <p>The rocks and minerals in the school set of “Typical Rocks and
      Minerals of Illinois” are included, plus other relatively common ones
      you might find in Illinois. Because of the great diversity of rocks and
      minerals in this state, the keys are not conclusive. It is therefore suggested
      you consult other more complete keys (such as that in Dana’s
      <i>Manual of Mineralogy</i>) when identifying rocks and minerals that are either
      from other states or are difficult to identify.</p>
    <p>The minerals are arranged in two groups: 1) those with
      a metallic luster, and 2) those with a nonmetallic luster. Each group is
      arranged according to increasing hardness. Other characteristics such
      as color, streak, cleavage, fracture, and composition are listed.</p>
    <p>The rocks are arranged according to their reaction to
      dilute hydrochloric acid applied to a scratched surface. (The acid reacts
      more readily to powdered material produced by scratching the rock.) After
      the reaction to acid has been determined, the texture and components
      of the rock should be noted. Because rocks grade into one another, clear
      distinctions are not always possible.</p>

      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Minerals</h2>

    <p>Most minerals grow into distinctive shapes if they are free to grow. A familiar example is the formation of salt crystals that grow on a saucer of evaporating salt water. The distinctive shapes of crystals are called their habits, and the flat surfaces that develop are called crystal faces, the angles of which may be used to identify the mineral.</p>

      <p>There are other physical features useful in identifying minerals. Some of them, such as color, are quite obvious. The color of the powder left when a mineral is scraped on a rough, white surface, such as unglazed porcelain or tile, is called streak. Luster refers to the brightness of light reflected from the mineral’s surface. Transparency and translucency refer to the mineral’s ability to transmit light, and tenacity is a measure of its toughness.</p>

        <h3 slot="header">Granite</h3>
        <div slot="panel">
          Granite is one of the most widespread intrusive (originating deep within the earth) igneous rocks. It consists chiefly of feldspar and quartz with small amounts of biotite, muscovite, or hornblende. Most granite is light colored, but it can be white, gray, yellow, pink, or deep red. The texture ranges from medium grained to coarse grained.

          Granite pebbles or boulders are the most common igneous rocks found in glacial deposits in Illinois. They are not native to the state but were brought here by the great ice sheets or glaciers that advanced from southern Canada to cover much of northern United States during Pleistocene time.

          Native granitic rock probably lies very deep beneath the entire state. It has been found in deep oil-test drillings along the western and northern margins of Illinois.
        </div>
      </il-accordion-section>
      <il-accordion-section>
        <h3 slot="header">Gabbro</h3>
        <div slot="panel">
          Gabbro is another intrusive igneous rock, but it is heavier and darker than granite. It is composed mainly of feldspar and dark iron-bearing minerals that give the rock a dark color. It is coarse grained and contains little or no quartz.

          Mineral crystals of gabbro are especially tightly interlocked, making the rock very difficult to break. Weathered gabbro is a rusty color on the surface, because the iron in gabbro changes color just as a piece of metallic iron becomes coated with rust when left out of doors.

          Like other igneous rocks found near the surface in Illinois, gabbro was carried into Illinois by the glaciers and deposited as glacial debris.
        </div>
      </il-accordion-section>
      <il-accordion-section>
        <h3 slot="header">Porphyry</h3>
        <div slot="panel">
          Porphyry is an igneous rock identified by its texture rather than its mineral content, which is variable. Distinct crystals (phenocrysts) of minerals are embedded in a matrix of fine-grained rock. The phenocrysts formed before the main mass of the rock hardened.

          Any igneous rock may have a porphyritic variety, such as granite porphyry and rhyolite porphyry, although porphyries are most likely to form in association with fine-grained igneous rocks.

          Porphyry is found in Illinois only in glacial drift.
        </div>
      </il-accordion-section>
      <il-accordion-section>
        <h3 slot="header">Peridotite</h3>
        <div slot="panel">
          Peridotite is the only igneous rock native to Illinois that crops out at the surface. It is found as dikes (irregular veins) or sills (thin sheets) that were formed when molten rock from deeper in the earth intruded into cracks and fissures in the bedrock of southeastern Illinois (Hardin, Pope, Gallatin, and Saline Counties). Peridotite pebbles and boulders also may be found in the glacial drift.

          Peridotite ranges from very fine grained to medium grained and has an even texture. It is dark gray to greenish gray, depending on the minerals present. In general it is composed of olivine, hornblende, pyroxene, and mica, with little or no feldspar or quartz.
        </div>
      </il-accordion-section>
    </il-accordion>

    <h2>Rocks</h2>

    <p>Rocks, being mixtures of minerals, are more complex than minerals and are therefore classified in a more complicated way. The broadest grouping of rocks is based on the origin of the rock rather than on the minerals that compose it. In this scheme all rocks are divided into three general groups, igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic.

      <p>The igneous rocks are mentioned first because they are produced directly from hot liquids that come from deep within the earth. These hot liquids are essentially molten rock and are called magmas. When they cool, the elements of the individual minerals come together and crystallize, as water crystallizes into ice on a winter day.

      <p>Different minerals crystallize, or “freeze”, at different temperatures so that if the magma cools slowly some individual grains have opportunity to grow larger than others. If the magma cools quickly, as does lava or basalt, the separate mineral grains will be small. Igneous rocks are classified on the basis of the size and arrangement of the individual crystals and the kinds of minerals present.</p>
