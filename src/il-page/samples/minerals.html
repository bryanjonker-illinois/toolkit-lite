  </il-hero>

  <il-section>

    <p class="il-lede">Illinois has so long been known as the Prairie State that
      it seems a most unlikely place in which to
      collect rock and mineral specimens. But Illinois has a surprising wealth of rock and mineral resources,
      not only to be collected as interesting specimens but
      to be put to practical and profitable use.</p>

    <p>The rich prairies that gave the state its nickname are themselves
      derived from ancient rocks, worn and changed by millions
      of years of action by weather, water, wind, plants, and animals.
      Unmeasured depths of rock underlie the prairies, hills, and valleys,
      and in some parts of the state are exposed in outcrops,
      canyons, and river valleys. Boulders and gravel brought in by
      the glaciers thousands of years ago are strewn over many parts
      of the state.</p>

    <h2>Description of Rocks and Minerals</h2>

    <p>The terms <dfn>mineral</dfn> and <dfn>rock</dfn> are often confused. They are
      frequently used together and the materials they describe are
      closely related. In general, a mineral is a naturally occurring
      chemical element or compound formed by inorganic processes,
      whereas a rock is a mixture of particles or grains of several minerals.</p>

    <p>However, when we refer to mineral resources or industrial
      minerals, we generally include materials that are technically
      rocks&mdash;such as limestone, dolomite, shale&mdash;and also coal and
      oil that are in fact organic substances. On the other hand, we
      include in the rock category high purity sandstone that is composed
      almost entirely of one mineral (quartz) and high purity
      limestone that is composed largely of the mineral calcite.</p>

  </il-section>

  <il-section>

    <h2>Minerals</h2>

    <p>A few minerals are composed of only one element, such as
      diamond (carbon) and native copper, but most minerals are chemical
      compounds that contain several elements.</p>
    <p>Most minerals grow into distinctive shapes if they are free
      to grow. A familiar example is the formation of salt crystals that
      grow on a saucer of evaporating salt water. The distinctive
      shapes of crystals are called their <b>habits</b>, and the flat surfaces
      that develop are called <b>crystal faces</b>, the angles of which may
      be used to identify the mineral.</p>

        <h2>Limestone</h2>
        <p>Limestone outcrops are abundant in Illinois, especially along
          the bluffs of the Mississippi, Ohio, and Illinois Rivers.</p>
        <p>Limestone effervesces freely in dilute hydrochloric acid,
          but dolomite must be powdered before it will effervesce. In nature,
          limestones may be dissolved by percolating water containing
          weak acid (such as carbonic acid, composed of water and
          carbon dioxide). At many places in southern and southwestern
          Illinois such solution of limestones has produced caves and
          caverns.</p>

        <h2>Granite</h2>
        <p>Granite pebbles or boulders are the most common igneous
          rocks found in glacial deposits in Illinois. They are not native
          to the state but were brought here by the great ice sheets or glaciers
          that advanced from southern Canada to cover much of northern
          United States during Pleistocene time.</p>
        <p>Native granitic rock probably lies very deep beneath the entire
          state. It has been found in deep oil-test drillings along the
          western and northern margins of Illinois.</p>

        <img slot="image" src="assets/dylan-mcleod-4X5ySjDNLPg-unsplash.jpg" alt="Limestone">
        <h2>Gabbro</h2>
        <p>Gabbro is another intrusive igneous rock, but it is heavier
          and darker than granite. It is composed mainly of feldspar and
          dark iron-bearing minerals that give the rock a dark color. It is
          coarse grained and contains little or no quartz.</p>
        <p>Like other igneous rocks found near the surface in Illinois,
          gabbro was carried into Illinois by the glaciers and deposited as
          glacial debris.</p>

    <h2>Rocks</h2>

    <p>Rocks, being mixtures of minerals, are more complex than
      minerals and are therefore classified in a more complicated way.
      The broadest grouping of rocks is based on the origin of the rock
      rather than on the minerals that compose it. In this scheme all
      rocks are divided into three general groups, <b>igneous</b>, <b>sedimentary</b>,
      and <b>metamorphic</b>.</p>
    <p>The igneous rocks are mentioned first because they are produced
      directly from hot liquids that come from deep within the
      earth. These hot liquids are essentially molten rock and are
      called <b>magmas</b>. When they cool, the elements of the individual
      minerals come together and crystallize, as water crystallizes
      into ice on a winter day.</p>

        <h3>Porphyry</h3>
        <p>Porphyry is an igneous rock identified by its texture rather
          than its mineral content, which is variable. Distinct crystals
          (phenocrysts) of minerals are embedded in a matrix of fine-grained
          rock. The phenocrysts formed before the main mass of
          the rock hardened.</p>
        <p>Any igneous rock may have a porphyritic variety, such as
          granite porphyry and rhyolite porphyry, although porphyries are
          most likely to form in association with fine-grained igneous
          rocks.</p>
        <p>Porphyry is found in Illinois only in glacial drift.</p>
      </il-card-with-image>

      <il-card-with-image role="listitem">
        <img slot="image" src="assets/dylan-mcleod-4X5ySjDNLPg-unsplash.jpg" alt="Limestone">
        <h3>Basalt</h3>
        <p>Basalt is the most widely distributed volcanic rock. Pyroxene,
          feldspar, magnetite (an iron ore), and in some instances
          olivine, biotite, and hornblende, compose this rock. The dark
          green, gray, or black color is due to the dark-colored minerals
          that make up much of the rock. The minerals in basalt are fine
          grained and are packed closely together. Phenocrysts of olivine,
          pyroxene, and hornblende may be present. Basalt is easily identified
          by its color and fine-grained texture.</p>
        <p>The glaciers brought basalt into Illinois along with other
          igneous rocks.</p>

        <img slot="image" src="assets/dylan-mcleod-4X5ySjDNLPg-unsplash.jpg" alt="Limestone">
        <h3>Peridotite</h3>
        <p>Peridotite is the only igneous rock native to Illinois that
          crops out at the surface. It is found as dikes (irregular veins)
          or sills (thin sheets) that were formed when molten rock from
          deeper in the earth intruded into cracks and fissures in the bedrock
          of southeastern Illinois (Hardin, Pope, Gallatin, and Saline
          Counties). Peridotite pebbles and boulders also may be found in
          the glacial drift.</p>

  <p>The individual atoms of a crystal always arrange themselves
    in the same way, so that each mineral breaks characteristically.
    Some minerals break more easily in particular directions and present
    a flat, smooth surface. This characteristic is called <b>cleavage</b>
    and the cleavage surfaces, although sometimes confused
    with crystal faces, may be useful for identifying a particular
    mineral. The manner in which a mineral breaks when the broken
    surface does not include cleavage surfaces is called its <b>fracture</b>,
    and this too may give a clue to the identification of the mineral.</p>
  <p>There are other physical features useful in identifying minerals.
    Some of them, such as <b>color</b>, are quite obvious. The
    color of the powder left when a mineral is scraped on a rough,
    white surface, such as unglazed porcelain or tile, is called
    <b>streak</b>. <b>Luster</b> refers to the brightness of light reflected from the
    mineral’s surface. <b>Transparency</b> and <b>translucency</b> refer to the
    mineral’s ability to transmit light, and <b>tenacity</b> is a measure of
    its toughness.</p>
  <p>Two special physical characteristics of minerals are important
    to their identification—specific gravity and hardness.
    <b>Specific gravity</b> simply means the ratio of the weight of the mineral
    to an equivalent volume of water. For example, if a mineral
    has a specific gravity of 4, then a cubic inch of the mineral
    weighs as much as 4 cubic inches of water.</p>
  <p><b>Hardness</b> is measured by the ability of one mineral to scratch
    another, and a set of ten standard minerals has been selected
    for determining this characteristic. The listing below, from soft
    to hard, is known as Mohs scale.</p>

<p>These resources are of great value. Besides the rich agriculture
  based on the rock-derived soil, much of our industry,
  manufacturing, and transportation is dependent on rock and mineral
  materials. Every county in Illinois possesses some rocks
  and minerals that either are being used or have potential future
  value.</p>
<p>The Illinois State Geological Survey several years ago began
  to prepare sets of typical rocks and minerals of Illinois for
  use by the schools and other educational groups in Illinois.
  This booklet is designed to furnish a brief geological background
  and explanation of these common Illinois rocks and minerals.
  It also should be useful to the student or amateur interested in
  making his own collection.</p>
<p>Even though Illinois has no mountain ranges or deep canyons,
  the geology of the state has many complexities. In fact,
  the very flatness of our topography is a complicating factor because
  in order to study the geology at many places in the state
  it is necessary to use information from mines and descriptions
  (logs) and samples (cores) of the rock penetrated during drilling
  of deep wells. There are also geophysical methods of learning
  something about the rocks beneath the surface.</p>

<p>The complexity of Illinois geology is not produced by the upturning
  and sharp folding of rock layers such as can be seen in
  the Rocky Mountains, but rather by the changes in composition,
  thickness, and character of the rock layers that are only gently
  warped or relatively flat. At several places in the state, especially
  in the southern part, faults, or breaks, in the rock layers
  do occur, but over much of our area this is not common.</p>
<p>The presence of usable minerals at considerable depth is
  known at many places; coal is mined from depths greater than
  800 feet, and oil is produced from saturated rock layers, called
  pay zones, several thousand feet below the surface. Lead and
  zinc ores, fluorspar, silica sand, limestone, sand, gravel, clay,
  and shale are all produced at shallower depths. However, the
  student can see only those rocks and minerals that are to be
  found at or near the surface. For that reason the following paragraphs
  describing their geologic occurrence deal only with surface
  geology.</p>
<p>The youngest of the major geologic divisions of our rocks is
  called the Pleistocene, which is the scientific name for the “Ice
  Age” deposits. During this relatively recent period of geologic
  time, which began about a million years ago, glaciers flowed
  southward from Canada and spread a layer of “glacial drift” over
  all of the state except the northwest corner, the southwest edge
  of the state along the Mississippi River, and extreme southern
  Illinois (<a href="#fig1" >fig. 1</a>).</p>
<p>Most of the glacial deposits that we see were formed by the
  last two of the four major periods of glacial advance, the Illinoian
  and the Wisconsin. The Illinoian was the most extensive,
  reaching as far south as Carbondale and Harrisburg. The Wisconsin,
  so called because its deposits are so widely spread in
  that state, reached only to Mattoon and Peoria.</p>
<p>The glacial drift is the youngest and uppermost of the divisions
  of the rock column (<a href="#fig2" >fig. 2</a>). Within the drift can be found
  the widest diversity of rock and mineral types—quartzite, schist,
  and other metamorphic rocks; granite, gabbro, and other igneous
  rocks; and of course the sedimentary rocks, limestone, dolomite,
  sandstone, shale, and even pieces of coal, which occur in bedded
  layers of the older rocks in Illinois.</p>
<p>Sand and gravel were carried and deposited by flowing
  streams before, during, and after glaciation, but the major deposits
  were made while the glaciers were melting. They contain
  a wide variety of rock and mineral types.</p>

<p>As shown by the diagrammatic rock column (<a href="#fig2" >fig. 2</a>), rocks
  placed in the divisions called early Cenozoic and Mesozoic are
  next in age to the Pleistocene. The map (<a href="#fig1" >fig. 1</a>) shows that the
  Cenozoic and Mesozoic rocks occur only in the extreme southern
  tip of Illinois because only that part of Illinois was covered by a
  northward extension of the forerunner of the Gulf of Mexico in
  which the deposits of sand, gravel, and clay were laid down.</p>
<p>The next older division of Illinois rocks is called Pennsylvanian—or
  “Coal Measures”—because during the last century
  they were first extensively described by geologists working in
  Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvanian is one of our most important groups of
  rock strata because it contains all of our minable coal beds, as
  well as important deposits of limestone, shale, clay, sandstone,
  and some oil and gas. The Pennsylvanian rocks are very widespread
  in Illinois, occurring under the glacial drift from depths
  of a few feet to several hundred feet throughout about two-thirds
  of the glaciated area (<a href="#fig1" >fig. 1</a>).</p>
<p>Next below the Pennsylvanian are the Mississippian rocks.
  We in Illinois are particularly interested in this division of rocks
  because they take their name from the excellent exposures along
  the Mississippi River valley in western Illinois, southeastern
  Iowa, and eastern Missouri. They are composed of extensive
  beds of limestone and cherty limestone, sandstone, and shale.</p>
<p>Mississippian rocks are of great economic importance in the
  structural area known as the Illinois Basin, where they are the
  most important oil producing rocks. They also contain our fluorspar
  deposits and along the valley bluffs are an excellent source
  of limestone for quarrying.</p>
<p>Rocks older than the Mississippian—except for small areas
  along the Mississippi and Illinois River valleys—are found at
  the surface only in the northern quarter of the state and locally
  in Hardin County near the southern tip of the state. They are
  nonetheless economically important because from these older
  rocks are produced lead and zinc, some oil and gas, silica sand,
  limestone, dolomite, and shale.</p>
<p>On the generalized rock column (<a href="#fig2" >fig. 2</a>) these older rocks are
  grouped into two units. The uppermost contains the Devonian and
  Silurian and the lower contains the Ordovician and Cambrian. In
  general they include dolomite, limestone, and shale, with sandstone
  at several places, especially in the lower unit.</p>


<h3 id="c2"> <span >Minerals</span></h3>
<p>A few minerals are composed of only one element, such as

    <li>Corundum</li>
    <li>Diamond</li>
  </ol>

<p>A rough measure of hardness can be made by using handy
  objects. Your fingernail has a hardness ranging from 2 to 3, a
  penny is a little harder than 3, window glass ranges from less
  than 5 to approximately 6 in hardness, and a knife blade is
  generally in the range of 5 to 6.</p>

<h3 id="c3"> <span >Rocks</span></h3>
<p>Rocks, being mixtures of minerals, are more complex than
  minerals and are therefore classified in a more complicated way.
  The broadest grouping of rocks is based on the origin of the rock
  rather than on the minerals that compose it. In this scheme all
  rocks are divided into three general groups, <b>igneous</b>, <b>sedimentary</b>,
  and <b>metamorphic</b>.</p>
<p>The igneous rocks are mentioned first because they are produced
  directly from hot liquids that come from deep within the
  earth. These hot liquids are essentially molten rock and are
  called <b>magmas</b>. When they cool, the elements of the individual
  minerals come together and crystallize, as water crystallizes
  into ice on a winter day.</p>
<p>Different minerals crystallize, or “freeze”, at different temperatures
  so that if the magma cools slowly some individual
  grains have opportunity to grow larger than others. If the magma
  cools quickly, as does lava or basalt, the separate mineral grains
  will be small. Igneous rocks are classified on the basis of the
  size and arrangement of the individual crystals and the kinds of
  minerals present.</p>
<p>The glacial drift in Illinois contains many pieces of igneous
  and metamorphic rocks, but most of the rocks native to Illinois
  are sedimentary.</p>
<p>Some sedimentary rocks are made up of weathered fragments
  of other rocks that have been moved by rivers, waves, winds, or
  glaciers. These sediments have been deposited and later compacted
  or cemented by the mineral matter carried in water moving
  through them. Such sedimentary rocks are called <b>clastic</b> (meaning
  broken pieces) rocks, as opposed to those formed by chemical
  precipitation from water and those that consist of fossil
  remains.</p>
<p>Clastic sedimentary rocks are classified first on the basis
  of the size of the grains of gravel, sand, silt, and clay of which
  they are composed; on the type of deposition, such as glacial
  drift and wind-blown silt or loess, that produced them; and then
  on the basis of their mineral composition. Rocks such as gypsum
  and some of our limestones were formed by chemical precipitation
  from sea water.</p>
<p>Metamorphic rock literally means rock that has changed
  form. The change of form has been caused by heat and pressures
  that occur below the surface of the earth or by heat from upward
  moving hot magmas or melted rocks. Examples of metamorphic
  rocks are found in Illinois as boulders and pebbles in the glacial
  drift.</p>
<p>Descriptions of the rocks and minerals represented by specimens
  in the Geological Survey’s rock and mineral sets follow.
  The numbers preceding the descriptions correspond to the numbers
  on the specimens in the sets.</p>
<p>Although the set includes the rocks and minerals that are
  most commonly found in Illinois, many others can be collected.
  For that reason, following the descriptions is a key for identifying
  other Illinois minerals and rocks.</p>
<p>As a further aid to the beginner and the amateur, a list of
  equipment useful in making a rock and mineral collection is given
  at the end of the book.</p>

<h4 id="c4"> <span >Granite</span></h4>
<p>GRANITE is one of the most widespread intrusive (originating
  deep within the earth) igneous rocks. It consists chiefly of feldspar
  and quartz with small amounts of biotite, muscovite, or
  hornblende. Most granite is light colored, but it can be white,
  gray, yellow, pink, or deep red. The texture ranges from medium
  grained to coarse grained.</p>
<p>Granite pebbles or boulders are the most common igneous
  rocks found in glacial deposits in Illinois. They are not native
  to the state but were brought here by the great ice sheets or glaciers
  that advanced from southern Canada to cover much of northern
  United States during Pleistocene time.</p>
<p>Native granitic rock probably lies very deep beneath the entire
  state. It has been found in deep oil-test drillings along the
  western and northern margins of Illinois.</p>
<h2 id="c5"> <span >GABBRO <span id="m2">(2)</span></span></h2>
<p>GABBRO is another intrusive igneous rock, but it is heavier
  and darker than granite. It is composed mainly of feldspar and
  dark iron-bearing minerals that give the rock a dark color. It is
  coarse grained and contains little or no quartz.</p>
<p>Mineral crystals of gabbro are especially tightly interlocked,
  making the rock very difficult to break. Weathered gabbro is a
  rusty color on the surface, because the iron in gabbro changes
  color just as a piece of metallic iron becomes coated with rust
  when left out of doors.</p>
<p>Like other igneous rocks found near the surface in Illinois,
  gabbro was carried into Illinois by the glaciers and deposited as
  glacial debris.</p>
<h2 id="c6"> <span >PORPHYRY <span id="m3">(3)</span></span></h2>
<p>PORPHYRY is an igneous rock identified by its texture rather
  than its mineral content, which is variable. Distinct crystals
  (phenocrysts) of minerals are embedded in a matrix of fine-grained
  rock. The phenocrysts formed before the main mass of
  the rock hardened.</p>
<p>Any igneous rock may have a porphyritic variety, such as
  granite porphyry and rhyolite porphyry, although porphyries are
  most likely to form in association with fine-grained igneous
  rocks.</p>
<p>Porphyry is found in Illinois only in glacial drift.</p>

<h2 id="c7"> <span >BASALT <span id="m4">(4)</span></span></h2>
<p>BASALT is the most widely distributed volcanic rock. Pyroxene,
  feldspar, magnetite (an iron ore), and in some instances
  olivine, biotite, and hornblende, compose this rock. The dark
  green, gray, or black color is due to the dark-colored minerals
  that make up much of the rock. The minerals in basalt are fine
  grained and are packed closely together. Phenocrysts of olivine,
  pyroxene, and hornblende may be present. Basalt is easily identified
  by its color and fine-grained texture.</p>
<p>The glaciers brought basalt into Illinois along with other
  igneous rocks.</p>

<h2 id="c8"> <span >PERIDOTITE <span id="m5">(5)</span></span></h2>
<p>PERIDOTITE is the only igneous rock native to Illinois that
  crops out at the surface. It is found as dikes (irregular veins)
  or sills (thin sheets) that were formed when molten rock from
  deeper in the earth intruded into cracks and fissures in the bedrock
  of southeastern Illinois (Hardin, Pope, Gallatin, and Saline
  Counties). Peridotite pebbles and boulders also may be found in
  the glacial drift.</p>
<p>Peridotite ranges from very fine grained to medium grained
  and has an even texture. It is dark gray to greenish gray, depending
  on the minerals present. In general it is composed of
  olivine, hornblende, pyroxene, and mica, with little or no feldspar
  or quartz.</p>


<h2 id="c9"> <span >Gneiss and Schist</span></h2>

<h3>Gneiss</h3>
<p>GNEISS is a metamorphic rock composed of roughly parallel
  bands of minerals. It is medium grained to coarse grained and
  is generally light in color. The names given to gneiss emphasize
  a distinctive texture or mineral or indicate composition. For example,
  biotite gneiss emphasizes a mineral, and granite gneiss
  indicates the composition of the rock.</p>

<h3>Schist</h3>
<p>SCHIST is much like gneiss but is fine grained and has a
  thinly layered structure that makes the rock break with a wavy
  surface. Some common types of schistose rocks are talc schist,
  chlorite schist, and hornblende schist. As the names indicate,
  they are characterized by their dominant mineral. Mica schist
  may be formed by the metamorphism of either sedimentary or igneous
  rocks.</p>
<p>Gneiss and schist are not native to Illinois but are found in
  the glacial drift.</p>

<h2 id="c10"> <span >CONGLOMERATE <span id="m7">(7)</span></span></h2>
<p>CONGLOMERATE is a sedimentary rock made up of pebbles
  or other rock fragments cemented in a background or matrix of
  finer material, generally
  silica, calcium carbonate,
  clay, iron oxide, or a
  mixture of these substances.
  The rounded
  rock fragments have
  been worn by being
  rolled in streams and
  along beaches.</p>

<p>If the pebbles embedded
  in the matrix are sharp and
  angular, freshly broken and not
  worn, the rock is called breccia
  and is generally found near the place where the fragments originated.
  Conglomerate or breccia may be made up of any type of
  rock or mineral, most commonly durable material such as chert,
  quartz, quartzite, granite, and gneiss.</p>
<p>In Illinois, conglomerates commonly are found at the base of
  sandstone formations and as beds in the lower “Coal Measures.”
  They also are found in some gravel deposits.</p>
<h2 id="c11"> <span >SANDSTONE <span id="m8">(8)</span></span></h2>
<p>SANDSTONE is a clastic sedimentary rock consisting of
  sand-sized grains (one sixty-fourth to one-sixteenth inch in
  diameter) held together by a cementing material. As sandstones
  become finer grained they grade into siltstones; as they become
  coarser grained they grade into conglomerate. The shape of sand
  grains in sandstones ranges from rounded to angular.</p>
<p>Quartz is the dominant mineral in sandstone, but other rock
  grains and mineral grains (especially chalcedony, feldspar, muscovite,
  hornblende, magnetite, or garnet) generally are present.</p>
<p>Sandstones are commonly cemented by carbonates, silica,
  iron oxides, or clays. Most sandstones are a shade of gray or
  brown, but the color may vary from gray or white to yellow,
  brown, or red. The color probably depends on the type of cement,
  the amount of organic material present, and the amount and degree
  of oxidation of iron in the rock.</p>
<p>Durability of sandstones depends largely on the character
  of the cement. Some sandstones crumble easily, but others, especially
  those cemented by iron oxides or silica, are tough and
  durable. Sandstones break around the grains, giving the broken
  surface a granular appearance.</p>
<p>Sandstone crops out in many places throughout much of the
  state. In LaSalle and Ogle Counties, large tonnages of sand are
  mined from the St. Peter Sandstone and sold for a variety of uses,
  including abrasive sand, molding sand, and sand for making
  glass. In extreme southern Illinois attractively colored sandstones
  have been quarried for building stone.</p>
<h2 id="c12"> <span >QUARTZITE <span id="m9">(9)</span></span></h2>
<p>QUARTZITE is a metamorphic rock that originally was quartz
  sandstone. Quartzites are produced by intense heat and/or
  pressure, probably aided by hot silica-bearing solutions. The
  quartz grains may be so closely interlocked that individual grains
  are no longer recognizable. The rock fractures conchoidally
  through both the grains and cement, so the broken surface, unlike
  that of sandstone, is smooth and may even be glassy like
  quartz.</p>
<p>Color depends upon the amount and kind of impurities present.
  A quartzite that is all quartz is white or gray, but iron or
  other elements may change the color to shades of purple, yellow,
  brown, or red. Quartzite is a very resistant, hard rock and cannot
  be scratched by a knife.</p>
<p>Quartzite is abundant as boulders and pebbles in glacial
  drift of Illinois, having been brought into the state during the
  “Ice Age.”</p>
<h2 id="c13"> <span >SHALE <span id="m10">(10)</span></span></h2>
<p>SHALE is a common and important sedimentary rock composed
  of compacted clay or mud. It is so fine grained that the minerals
  forming it generally cannot be identified without the aid of X-ray.</p>
<p>Shales are composed mainly of clay minerals but, like other
  sedimentary rocks, generally include other minerals. Shales
  containing calcium carbonate are called calcareous shales. Most
  shales contain silt or sand particles; if silt or sand is present
  in large quantity, the rock is called silty shale or sandy shale.
  If mica minerals are present in quantity in a shale it is called
  micaceous shale.</p>
<p>The particles of most clay minerals are thin and flat and
  overlap each other.</p>

<p>Shales have a wide range of colors but most of those in Illinois
  are gray. A gray, black, or blue-gray color is caused by
  organic matter in the shale; shades of red, brown, yellow, or
  green are caused by iron compounds.</p>
<p>Shale is widely distributed in Illinois, especially in “Coal
  Measures” rocks, and is used in manufacturing bricks, drain
  tile, building tile, and lightweight aggregate.</p>
<h2 id="c14"> <span >CLAY <span id="m11">(11)</span></span></h2>
<p>CLAY is an unconsolidated rock made up of a group of hydrous
  aluminum silicate minerals, of which chlorite, montmorillonite,
  kaolinite, and illite are the most abundant. These minerals
  are formed by the weathering or alteration of other rocks
  and minerals.</p>
<p>Clays are very fine grained and their minerals have tiny, flat
  crystals that can be distinguished from each other only by laboratory
  methods. Although clays may appear to be similar, their
  compositions vary greatly.</p>
<p>Some clays are white, but most are colored by iron compounds
  and organic matter. Wet clays have an earthy odor and
  generally are slick and plastic, but dry clays are relatively hard
  and are greasy to the touch.</p>
<p>Clays are abundant in Illinois, especially in soils, in
  shales, and as clay deposits. In Illinois the underclays that
  occur beneath coal beds are particularly well suited to the manufacture
  of bricks, pottery, stoneware, and drain tile.</p>
<h2 id="c15"> <span >LIMESTONE <span id="m12">(12)</span></span></h2>
<p>LIMESTONE is a sedimentary rock composed of particles of
  calcite (calcium carbonate). The crystals may range from fine to
  coarse. Many limestones contain other minerals, such as chert,
  clay, or sand, and in some places they grade into dolomite (calcium
  magnesium carbonate).</p>
<p>Many limestones are white or gray. Yellow or brown shades
  are caused by iron oxide impurities and dark gray to black colors
  by organic matter.</p>
<p>Limestones form in various ways. Some are deposited when
  calcium carbonate precipitates from solution; others are formed
  when the shells or skeletons of organisms such as brachiopods,
  clams, and corals accumulate on a sea floor. If such fossils
  are very abundant, the rock is called fossiliferous limestone.

  Limestone composed of tiny, rounded concretions is called <b>oolite</b>
  or oolitic limestone.</p>
<p>Limestone effervesces freely in dilute hydrochloric acid,
  but dolomite must be powdered before it will effervesce. In nature,
  limestones may be dissolved by percolating water containing
  weak acid (such as carbonic acid, composed of water and
  carbon dioxide). At many places in southern and southwestern
  Illinois such solution of limestones has produced caves and
  caverns.</p>
<p>Limestone outcrops are abundant in Illinois, especially along
  the bluffs of the Mississippi, Ohio, and Illinois Rivers.</p>
<p>Limestone has many uses. It is used for building stone,
  road surfacing, railroad ballast, in the manufacture of portland
  cement, and, if of high purity, for making lime and chemicals
  and as a flux in smelting metals. It also is used, as agricultural
  limestone, to add calcium to the soil.</p>



  <h2 id="c16"> <span >PEAT <span id="m13">(13)</span></span></h2>
<p>PEAT is produced by the partial decomposition of plants that
  accumulate, with varying amounts of mineral matter, in old
  ponds, swamps, and lakes, and in abandoned channels in valley
  bottoms along many rivers and streams. Peat may be an early
  stage in the formation of coal.</p>
<p>Peat ranges from light to dark brown, the color, decomposition,
  and compaction increasing with depth in the deposit. Some
  of the plant remains are clearly distinguishable and appear as
  fibrous fragments held together by the fine peat particles. The
  type of peat common in Illinois has a high water content. Before
  it is dried it is soft and spongy to the touch; upon drying, it
  loses much water and becomes harder.</p>
<p>Peat is used as a fuel in some parts of the world, but its
  heating value is low compared to that of coal. It burns with a
  long flame and leaves a great deal of ash because of the silt and
  sand that were buried with the vegetation. Peat and peat moss
  are used chiefly as an absorbent, as stable litter, as insulating
  and packing material, and by gardeners to increase the water-holding
  capacity of soils.</p>
<p>Peat is found in many places in Illinois but the largest deposits
  are in northeastern Illinois.</p>
<h2 id="c17"> <span >COAL <span id="m14">(14)</span></span></h2>
<p>COAL, an organic stratified rock, is formed from accumulated
  plant material and partially decayed plants that were buried
  during the “Coal Measures” period in Illinois more than 200 million
  years ago.</p>
<p>Sediments deposited over the peat-like organic material
  compacted it. Chemical changes gradually took place and resulted
  in the loss of water and gases, leaving a higher percentage
  of carbon than the original material contained.</p>
<p>The amount of such change that has taken place determines
  the rank of the coal. The lowest ranks are called <b>lignite</b>, the
  intermediate group is called <b>bituminous</b> (soft) coal, and coals of
  the highest rank, with the highest carbon content, are called
  <b>anthracite</b> (hard coal). Mineral matter, such as shale, clay, or
  pyrite, generally is present in the coal and becomes ash when
  the coal is burned.</p>
<p>Most coal mined in the United States is bituminous coal. It
  is black, brittle, breaks into angular blocks, has a shiny luster,
  and generally shows a banded structure.</p>
<p>Coal mining is an important industry in Illinois, and the
  state contains the largest known reserves of bituminous coal in
  the United States. Minable coal beds underlie about two-thirds
  of the state. As many as 20 different coal beds have been mined
  in Illinois, the most important being the Herrin (No. 6) and the
  Springfield (No. 5) or Harrisburg (No. 5). The coal in most mining
  areas averages 5 to 7 feet thick and in places attains a thickness
  of 15 feet.</p>
<p>In underground mines the coal is approached by vertical or
  inclined shafts. In open cut, or strip, mines all of the overlying
  material (overburden) is removed, leaving the coal exposed.
  Coal as much as 100 feet deep is now being strip mined in Illinois.</p>
<p>Illinois coal is now used mainly for generating electric power,
  for industrial purposes, and for heating. In industry, coal
  is used extensively for power, heating, burning cement, firing
  clay products such as brick, tile, pottery, porcelain, and china,
  and making coke.</p>
<p>Certain Illinois coals when mixed with coal from the eastern
  part of the United States, produce metallurgical coke for making
  steel. Gases, oils, and tars derived in processing coal for coke
  have been used for making many chemical products, including
  dyes, perfumes, explosives, medicines, insecticides, plastics,
  and road tar.</p>
<h2 id="c18"> <span >PETROLEUM <span id="m15">(15)</span></span></h2>
<p>PETROLEUM (crude oil) is classed as a mineral resource although
  it is a liquid hydrocarbon and not technically a mineral
  or rock. It is, however, found in the pores and fractures of
  rocks. The color of crude oil ranges from yellow through green
  and brown to black.</p>

<p>Petroleum had its origin in the
  plants and animals buried in ancient
  sediments. The organic matter changed
  slowly into the complex mixture of hydrogen
  and carbon compounds that is
  petroleum.</p>
<p>Because gas is lighter than oil,
  and oil in turn lighter than water, gas
  and oil move upward in a porous rock
  containing all three. Gas moves to
  the highest position with oil next below
  and water in the lowest part of the
  rock. Oil pools exist where geologic
  barriers have stopped the movement of
  gas and oil.</p>
<p>Arches (upward folds or anticlines),
  breaks (faults), and lateral
  changes from porous to nonporous rock
  are geologic features that serve to localize
  oil pools within the reservoir
  rock.</p>
<p>Petroleum is obtained by drilling
  wells into the reservoir rock. Gas that is free or dissolved in
  the petroleum expands as pressure is released when the well is
  drilled and drives the oil to the well. Water in the reservoir
  rock also acts as a driving force. When this natural pressure is
  no longer effective, other methods (secondary recovery) are used
  to recover the oil remaining in the reservoir.</p>
<p>Porous sandstones and limestones are the oil-bearing rocks.
  Illinois also has deposits of oil shale from which petroleum may
  be produced in the future.</p>
<p>Thousands of products are derived from petroleum, including
  gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, lubricating oils and waxes, medicinal
  oils, salves, heavy fuels, road oils, tar, and asphalt.</p>
<h2 id="c19"> <span >GLACIATED PEBBLES <span id="m16">(16)</span></span></h2>
<p>GLACIATED PEBBLES are small stones whose shapes have
  been altered by the grinding action of a glacier. Such pebbles
  commonly have at least one flattened side that shows scratches
  (called striae). The striae were produced when the pebbles were
  pushed over bedrock or ground against other pieces of rock.</p>
<p>Glaciers tore fragments from the bedrock over which they
  moved and the fragments accumulated in, on, and under the mass
  of ice. The rock fragments were transported, some of them far
  from their source, and were deposited as the glacier moved along
  or when the ice melted.</p>
<p>Soft rocks like limestone and dolomite are easily scratched,
  but soft rocks cannot make grooves in hard igneous and metamorphic
  rocks. Therefore soft rocks have more striae.</p>
<p>Glaciated pebbles can be found in deposits in many parts of
  the state, especially in northeastern and east-central Illinois.
  However, many deposits near the surface have been weathered
  and striae have been destroyed. An especially good place to
  look for striated pebbles is in quarries and strip mines where
  glacial drift overburden has been removed. Pebbles found in
  such deposits show good striae for they are but little weathered.</p>
<h2 id="c20"> <span >SILICA SAND <span id="m17">(17)</span></span></h2>
<p>SILICA SAND is the commercial name for sand composed almost
  entirely of grains of quartz. Sand of this kind is mined in
  Illinois from the St. Peter Sandstone in LaSalle and Ogle Counties.
  The coarser grains of the sand are characteristically rounded
  and frosted. The frosting causes the sand to look white.</p>
<p>Illinois silica sand has many uses. It is used just as it is
  mined for molding sand in which metal castings are made, for
  lining industrial furnaces, and for many other purposes. Some
  of the sand is washed to remove the small amount of impurities
  present. The washed sand is used for such purposes as making
  glass, for grinding plate glass smooth, for sand blasting, for
  molding metal, as fracturing sand to increase the production of
  oil wells. Some silica sand is ground to a fine powder and used
  as a fine abrasive, as a filler in paint, and as an ingredient in
  pottery, glazes, and enamel.</p>
<p>A specially prepared St. Peter sand, known throughout the
  world as Standard Ottawa Testing Sand, is used to test the strength
  of cements and as a laboratory standard in physical tests of other
  sands.</p>
<h2 id="c21"> <span >MOLDING SAND <span id="m18">(18)</span></span></h2>
<p>MOLDING SAND is a mixture of sand and clay or other bonding
  material and is used to make molds in which metal is cast
  into various useful shapes. There are two kinds of molding
  sands, synthetic and natural bonded. The first is an artificial
  mixture of silica sand and clay; the second is a naturally occurring
  mixture of sand and a bonding material.</p>
<p>For casting, molding sand is first moistened with water and
  shaped into a mold of the metal part to be reproduced. The mold
  is then allowed to dry and the molten metal poured into it. The
  bonding material in the sand must be strong enough to keep the
  mold in shape during these operations.</p>
<p>Natural bonded molding sand is produced in Fayette, Bond,
  Bureau, Carroll, Kankakee, and Rock Island Counties, Illinois.</p>
<h2 id="c22"> <span >TRIPOLI <span id="m19">(19)</span></span></h2>
<p>TRIPOLI, called amorphous silica in southern Illinois, is a
  white or light brown, powdery substance that rubs off on the
  hands like chalk. It consists mostly of very small particles of
  quartz that result from the weathering of calcareous chert or
  highly siliceous limestone.</p>
<p>It is finely ground and used as “white rouge” for polishing
  optical lenses, as a filler in paints, in making ceramic products,
  as a component of buffing compounds, and as a fine abrasive.</p>
<p>Tripoli occurs in Alexander and Union Counties and is milled
  at Elco and Tamms in Alexander County.</p>
<h2 id="c23"> <span >FULLER’S EARTH <span id="m20">(20)</span></span></h2>
<p>FULLER’S EARTH is clay or silty clay material that contains
  very fine silica. It is soft, nonplastic, opaque, has a greasy
  feel when wet, and does not readily break up in water. Its color
  varies from blue-gray to yellow or buff.</p>
<p>Fuller’s earth is valuable for its unique property of absorbing
  and decolorizing substances. The material was first used
  to “full” or remove grease from woolen cloth, hence its name.
  It also has been used to filter and bleach mineral and vegetable
  oils by absorbing dark organic matter.</p>
<p>In Pulaski County in extreme southern Illinois the Porter’s
  Creek Formation contains deposits of clay that were at one time
  the source of fuller’s earth and still afford clay whose absorbent
  properties make it useful as litter and as sweeping and cleaning
  compound.</p>
<h2 id="c24"> <span >QUARTZ <span id="m21">(21)</span></span></h2>
<p>QUARTZ is the most common of all minerals, making up about
  12 percent of the earth’s crust. There are two main types of
  quartz—crystalline quartz and dense, crypto-crystalline (submicroscopic)
  quartz. Many
  dense varieties occur in
  Illinois, probably the most
  common are chert or flint.</p>
<div >
  <img alt="uncaptioned" height="800" src="images/p06.jpg" width="669" id="ncfig4">
</div>
<p>Crystals of quartz are
  typically six-sided, elongated,
  have sharply pointed
  pyramid-like ends, and
  are apt to grow together
  forming twins. Good crystals
  are rare in Illinois,
  and the crystal structure
  is not apparent in the commonly
  occurring grains and
  masses.</p>
<p>Quartz is brittle and
  hard. It may be colorless
  or tinted, transparent or
  translucent, but more commonly
  it is white and nearly
  opaque. Transparent quartz looks much like ordinary glass,
  but it scratches glass easily. It has a glassy to brilliant luster
  and breaks irregularly or with a good conchoidal fracture.</p>
<p>Some varieties of quartz that are used for semiprecious gems
  are chalcedony, agate, onyx, and jasper. Chalcedony is waxy,
  smooth, generally translucent, white to gray, blue, brown, or
  black. Agate is a form of chalcedony that has a mottled or variegated
  banded appearance and may be yellow, green, red, brown,
  blue, gray, or black. Onyx is agate with parallel bands that as
  a rule are brown and white or black and white. Jasper, an impure
  opaque quartz, generally is red.</p>
<p>Quartz occurs as rock crystal (colorless, transparent),
  milky quartz (white, nearly opaque), and smoky quartz (smoky
  yellow to gray or brown) in geodes from the Warsaw and Keokuk
  Limestones of the Nauvoo-Hamilton-Warsaw area and as vein
  and cavity fillings associated locally with fluorite, sphalerite,
  and galena in extreme southern Illinois. It also occurs as vug
  (cavity) fillings in limestones and sandstones.</p>
<h2 id="c25"> <span >FELDSPAR <span id="m22">(22)</span></span></h2>
<p>FELDSPAR is the name applied to a group of minerals that
  are the second most common of all the earth’s minerals. All feldspars
  are composed of aluminum, silicon, and oxygen, combined
  with varying amounts of one or more metals, particularly potassium,
  sodium, calcium, and lithium.</p>
<p>The minerals are hard, have a smooth glassy or pearly luster,
  and cleave along two planes nearly at right angles to each
  other. Feldspars are fairly light weight. The streak is white,
  but the color of the mineral is highly variable, although potassium
  and sodium-bearing feldspar are commonly white or pink
  and most plagioclase feldspar is gray.</p>
<p>Feldspars are essential parts of the crystalline igneous
  rocks. Their decomposition products are present in most soils.
  In Illinois relatively small feldspar crystals can be found associated
  with quartz and other minerals in granite and gneiss boulders
  and pebbles in glacial drift.</p>
<h2 id="c26"> <span >MICA <span id="m23">(23)</span></span></h2>
<p>MICA is the name of a family of complex aluminum silicate
  minerals that can be split easily into paper-thin, flexible sheets.
  If broken across the grain at right angles to the flat, smooth surface
  they fracture raggedly. In a single mica crystal the sheets
  range from more or less transparent to translucent and are arranged
  one on top of another like a deck of cards.</p>
<p>Micas are tough and somewhat elastic, soft enough to be
  split and scratched by a fingernail, and are light weight. They
  have a nonmetallic, glassy or pearly luster, although yellow
  mica may appear to be metallic. Color and streak depend upon
  the chemical composition of the mineral. Muscovite, or white
  mica, contains potassium and makes a colorless or white streak.
  Biotite, or black mica, contains iron and magnesium and is commonly
  dark green or black, although it may be shades of yellow
  or brown; its streak is uncolored.</p>
<p>Mica is abundant as tiny, shimmering flakes in Illinois
  sands, sandstones, and shales (which are then said to be micaceous).
  It also is common in many varieties of igneous and
  metamorphic rocks. White or yellow flakes may show a brilliant
  luster and may be mistaken for silver, platinum, or gold, but
  those minerals are heavy and malleable whereas mica is not.</p>
<h2 id="c27"> <span >CALCITE <span id="m24">(24)</span></span></h2>
<p>CALCITE, a common rock-forming mineral, consists of calcium
  carbonate. The mineral is white or colorless, but impurities
  may tint it shades of yellow or gray. Transparent calcite is more
  rare than the tinted varieties.</p>
<p>Transparent calcite possesses the property of double refraction;
  an image appears double when viewed through a calcite
  cleavage block.</p>
<p>Calcite has a glassy luster, its streak is white or colorless.
  The mineral is of medium hardness and can be scratched by a
  penny or a piece of window glass but not by the fingernail. It is
  fairly light weight and effervesces freely in cold dilute hydrochloric
  acid.</p>
<div >
  <img alt="uncaptioned" height="660" src="images/p07.jpg" width="800" id="ncfig5">
</div>
<p>Calcite has a variety of crystal forms but in Illinois flattened
  block-shaped crystals and elongate crystals with tapering
  points (“dogtooth spar”) are the most common. When broken,
  calcite cleaves into six-sided blocks called rhombs.</p>
<p>Crystals of calcite are found in Illinois as linings in geodes
  in certain limestones and shales, especially in the Nauvoo-Hamilton-Warsaw
  area, and as crystalline masses in limestone
  and dolomite. Small amounts of clear crystalline calcite are associated
  with various ores in northwestern and extreme southern
  Illinois.</p>
<p>Calcite is the principal mineral in limestones and occurs as
  a component of many concretions.</p>
<h2 id="c28"> <span >FLUORITE <span id="m25">(25)</span></span></h2>
<p>FLUORITE, or fluorspar, is made up of the elements calcium
  and fluorine. The mineral is easily identified by its perfect
  cleavage, color, and hardness.</p>
<p>It occurs in cubic crystals that may be twinned but is more
  often found as irregular masses. It can be split into diamond-shaped,
  eight-sided forms (octahedrons). Fluorite is commonly
  gray, white, or colorless, but it may be green, blue, purple,
  pink, or yellow. The streak is colorless and the luster glassy.
  It can be scratched by a knife or a piece of window glass, is
  fairly light weight, and is transparent to translucent.</p>
<p>Extensive deposits of fluorite, one of Illinois’ important
  commercial minerals, occur in Hardin and Pope Counties in extreme
  southern Illinois, where it is associated with galena,
  sphalerite, calcite, barite, and other less abundant minerals.</p>
<p>Fluorite is used to make hydrofluoric acid, to form a fluid
  slag in the production of iron and steel, in the manufacture of
  aluminum, to make many chemical products, and in the ceramic
  industry, in which it is used to make colored glass, enamels, and
  glazes.</p>
<h2 id="c29"> <span >GYPSUM <span id="m26">(26)</span></span></h2>
<p>GYPSUM, hydrous calcium sulfate, is a colorless, transparent
  to translucent mineral when pure, but it often is stained yellow
  by impurities. It has a white streak, is soft enough to be
  scratched by a fingernail, and is light weight.</p>
<div >
  <img alt="uncaptioned" height="800" src="images/p08.jpg" width="328" id="ncfig6">
</div>
<p>Gypsum occurs in several forms. <b>Selenite</b>
  is a coarsely crystalline, transparent variety,
  composed of flat, nearly diamond-shaped crystals
  that can be split easily into thin sheets,
  have a glassy luster, and often grow together
  to form “fishtail twins.” Crystals of selenite
  occur in shales of the “Coal Measures” of
  southern, north-central, and western Illinois,
  and can be picked up at the surface.</p>
<p><b>Satin spar</b> has crystals like silky threads
  closely packed together, splits parallel to the
  fibers, and is found as fillings in rock cracks
  and as thin layers in shales. <b>Massive gypsum</b>
  is granular.</p>
<p>Gypsum deposits occur deep underground
  in Illinois but thus far have not been mined.</p>
<h2 id="c30"> <span >CHERT <span id="m27">(27)</span></span></h2>
<p>CHERT, one of the main forms of silicon dioxide, is cryptocrystalline
  (submicroscopic) quartz. Most of the chert in Illinois
  is white or gray, but impurities stain many deposits yellow,
  brown, or even pink. Chert is so hard that it can scratch glass
  and ordinary steel. It is fairly light weight, dense, opaque, and
  brittle; the luster is dull.</p>
<p><b>Flint</b>, a variety of chert, is generally dark colored, more
  dense, may have a glassy luster and be transparent in thin
  flakes. Both chert and flint have a smooth, curved (conchoidal)
  fracture, but flint tends to break with thinner, sharper edges.
  Indians used flint and chert to make arrow points and spearheads.</p>
<p>Chert occurs as rounded masses (nodules and concretions)
  or as irregular layers in limestones and dolomites in northern,
  western, southwestern, and southern Illinois. Because chert is
  hard and more resistant to weathering than limestone or dolomite,
  it often remains after the rest of the rock has weathered away.</p>
<p>Chert also is abundant in many glacial deposits because it
  is hard and resists solution. Streams that flow through cherty
  bedrock or glacial deposits carry pebbles along and concentrate
  them as gravel in stream channels. Cherty stream gravels are
  especially abundant in western and southern Illinois.</p>
<p>Brown chert gravels in the southern part of the state are
  used for road gravel. Other deposits in extreme southern Illinois,
  consisting of angular fragments of chert and a small amount
  of clay (known locally as novaculite gravel) also are used for
  road surfacing.</p>
<p>White and gray chert occur as massive bedrock deposits
  several hundred feet thick in Union and Alexander Counties.</p>
<h2 id="c31"> <span >PYRITE AND MARCASITE <span id="m28">(28)</span></span></h2>
<p>PYRITE and MARCASITE are iron disulfide compounds. They
  look much alike but have different crystal forms. Both are brittle,
  hard, brassy yellow with metallic luster, and opaque. The
  best distinguishing feature is crystal shape. The pyrite crystals
  are cubes, but the marcasite crystals are blade- or needle-shaped.</p>
<p>Pyrite and marcasite have been mistaken for gold because
  they are yellow and metallic and hence are sometimes referred
  to as “fool’s gold”. They, however, are harder than gold, tarnish,
  and leave a dark streak, whereas gold is soft, very heavy,
  does not tarnish, and leaves a yellow streak. Gold is malleable,
  but pyrite or marcasite are reduced to powder if they are pounded
  and give off a noticeable odor of sulfur dioxide gas if they are
  heated.</p>
<p>Pyrite and marcasite are found in many deposits in Illinois.
  They occur as grains or larger masses in some clays, shales,
  and limestones. They also occur with the lead and zinc ores of
  northwestern Illinois and, in small amounts, with the fluorite
  and associated minerals in the extreme southern part of the state.</p>
<p>Both pyrite and marcasite are common as surface coatings,
  veins, and concretionary structures in coal and in dark shales
  associated with coal. They are referred to as “coal brasses” or
  “sulfur” when found as impurities in coal.</p>
<p>A potential use for pyrite and marcasite is in the manufacture
  of sulfuric acid for industrial use. Coal brasses recovered
  from Illinois coal have been so used.</p>
<h2 id="c32"> <span >LIMONITE <span id="m29">(29)</span></span></h2>
<p>LIMONITE is an iron oxide containing water and has a complex
  chemical composition. The limonite found in Illinois may
  be yellow, orange, red, brown, or black, but its streak is always
  yellowish brown. The mineral may have a glassy or an
  earthy luster. It may be too hard to be scratched by a knife.
  It is of medium weight.</p>
<p>Limonite is common and occurs as concretions and cavity
  fillings in sedimentary rocks, and as coatings on them, especially
  sandstone. It also occurs as iron rust, as scum on stagnant
  water, and it accumulates around rootlets in soils. Small
  amounts color limestone, dolomite, clay, shale, sandstone, and
  gravel. Some sands are firmly cemented by brown or black limonite
  and look much like iron ore. Clays containing a high percentage
  of limonite are called ocher.</p>
<p>In some states limonite is mined as an iron ore, and in Illinois
  it was so used in Hardin County in the middle 1800’s, but
  deposits are not large enough for profitable use now.</p>
<h2 id="c33"> <span >SPHALERITE <span id="m30">(30)</span></span></h2>
<p>SPHALERITE, zinc sulfide, is a major ore of zinc. It has a
  resinous luster and a white, yellow, or brown streak. Illinois
  sphalerite is generally yellow, yellowish brown, reddish brown,
  or brownish black. It is of medium weight, brittle, can be
  scratched by a piece of window glass but not by a penny. It is
  commonly opaque but may be translucent on thin edges.</p>
<p>Sphalerite is mined with galena in northwestern Illinois and
  in extreme southern Illinois with galena and fluorite. Small crystals
  occasionally are found in limestones and as crystalline
  masses in clay-ironstone concretions.</p>
<h2 id="c34"> <span >GALENA <span id="m31">(31)</span></span></h2>
<p>GALENA, lead sulfide, is the principal ore of lead. It is
  steel gray, heavy, opaque, and has a bright metallic luster,
  though the shiny surface may be dulled by a coating of lead carbonate.
  It has a gray or black streak, is soft enough to mark paper,
  and can be scratched by a penny. The cube-shaped crystals
  readily break into cubic, right-angled fragments. Probably
  the most obvious features of the mineral are its bright metallic
  luster on fresh surfaces, high specific gravity, and cubic cleavage.</p>
<div >
  <img alt="uncaptioned" height="615" src="images/p09.jpg" width="800" id="ncfig7">
</div>
<p>At many places galena is argentiferous (silver-bearing), but
  Illinois galena is relatively unimportant for its silver content.
  As a source of lead, however, it is an important commercial
  product of the state.</p>
<p>Scattered pieces of galena are found at many places in Illinois.
  Some occur in the glacial deposits, others occur as small
  pockets and as crystals in limestones and geodes. In only
  two areas of the state are deposits of commercial value. In
  northwestern Illinois galena occurs in association with sphalerite;
  in extreme southern Illinois it occurs in association with
  fluorite and sphalerite.</p>
<h2 id="c35"> <span >CONCRETIONS <span id="m32">(32)</span></span></h2>
<p>CONCRETIONS are concentrations of inorganic sedimentary
  material within other sediments. Minerals that commonly form
  concretions are silica (in the form of opal, chert, chalcedony,
  and quartz), calcite, siderite, pyrite, marcasite, and limonite.</p>
<p>Concretions may form either as the sediment around them
  is forming or after the sediment around them has hardened. They
  may be formed when water containing dissolved minerals seeps
  through the sediment or rock and leaves a concentration of mineral
  matter in a cavity or around a central particle (nucleus) such
  as the remains of a plant or animal. Portions of rock may also
  become firmly cemented by such mineral matter.</p>
<p>Concretions range in size from minute particles to objects
  several feet in diameter. Shapes range from spheres to tubes.
  Many are globular or lumpy-surfaced, some are smooth. Because
  concretions generally are harder than the surrounding rock in
  which they have formed, they do not weather away as readily and
  may remain after the surrounding material has been eroded.</p>
<p>Concentrations of calcite are found in loess deposits. They
  may look like bizarre, knobby figurines, and the Germans called
  them loess kindchen (little children of the loess).</p>
<p>Ironstone concretions, especially common in many Illinois
  shales, are formed by a local concentration of the mineral siderite
  (iron carbonate) in the rock. The concretions found in
  weathered outcrops commonly are partly or entirely weathered to
  limonite. Some ironstone concretions grow together into odd
  shapes. Mazon Creek ironstone concretions of northeastern
  Illinois, world famous for their fossils, are sideritic. The concretions
  are commonly covered with limonite, the result of oxidation.</p>
<p>Limonite concretions, generally with a high content of clay,
  silt, or sand, occur in loess, shale, and sandstone.</p>
<p>Concretions of chert and other forms of silica are common in
  limestones. In many places, because of their greater resistance
  to weathering, lenses and nodules of chert protrude from the
  beds.</p>
<p>Pyrite or marcasite occur as concretions or concretion-like
  masses in some coal beds and in the black shales, sometimes
  popularly called “slates,” above coal beds. Some other Pennsylvanian
  clays and shales also contain concretions or coarsely
  crystalline aggregates of these minerals.</p>
<h2 id="c36"> <span >GEODES <span id="m33">(33)</span></span></h2>
<p>GEODES are roughly spherical bodies that may be filled with
  layers of minerals, lined with crystals, or both. The outer layer
  of geodes found in Illinois as a rule is composed of chalcedony,
  a form of finely crystalline silica.</p>
<p>Geodes differ from concretions in that they form inward from
  the outer shell, whereas concretions develop outward from a
  center. Even if geodes have been completely filled by mineral
  matter, their inward-projecting crystals prove that they formed
  within a cavity.</p>
<p>In a partly filled cavity, crystals generally are well formed
  because they grew without being crowded. Some of the best mineral
  specimens known in Illinois
  are found as crystal linings in
  geodes.</p>
<div >
  <img alt="uncaptioned" height="799" src="images/p10.jpg" width="659" id="ncfig8">
</div>
<p>Quartz is the most common
  mineral deposited in geodes, but
  calcite, aragonite, dolomite,
  siderite, pyrite, galena, fluorite,
  and sphalerite also are
  found.</p>
<p>Geodes ranging in size from
  less than one inch to a foot or
  more in diameter can be gathered
  from streams where they have
  accumulated as residual boulders
  after the rock in which they
  were enclosed has been eroded.</p>
<p>Hollow geodes are the most
  desirable because they have better crystals. They can be distinguished
  from solid ones by their comparative lightness of
  weight.</p>
<p>Geodes are commonly associated with limestone and dolomite,
  at some places with shale. In Illinois they can be found
  most easily in the Warsaw Formation in the area of Nauvoo,
  Hamilton, and Warsaw, but they also occur in other areas and
  other formations.</p>


<h2 id="c37"> <span >ANIMAL FOSSILS <span id="m34">(34)</span></span></h2>
<p>Prehistoric animals lived in water, on land, and in the air,
  and left both direct and indirect evidence of their existence,
  evidence we now call fossils.</p>
<p>Millions of ancient animals died without leaving a trace,
  but some, especially those that had hard parts such as shells,
  bones, or teeth, may be found preserved in rocks much as they
  were when buried beneath sediment on the floor of an ancient
  sea. Sometimes only imprints of the outside or fillings of the
  inside of the shells remain, the original material having been
  completely dissolved. Footprints of land or amphibious animals,
  burrows made by clams, or holes made by worms also are fossils.</p>
<div >
  <img alt="uncaptioned" height="800" src="images/p11.jpg" width="516" id="ncfig9">
</div>
<p>The animals whose remains are fossilized lived and died
  while the sediments that contained them were being deposited,
  and they provide clues to the types of life and climate then existing.
  Fossils of animals characteristic
  of a certain time are an index
  to the age of formations where
  they occur. For example, if a certain
  trilobite (an ancient relative of
  the crayfish and lobster) is known
  to have lived only during a definite
  time, then all rocks in which it is
  found are the same age.</p>
<p>Fossils of animals that lived
  in the sea are exposed in rocks in
  many parts of Illinois, especially
  in quarries, river bluffs, and road
  cuts.</p>
<p>The oldest fossils found in Illinois
  are shells of marine animals—snails,
  corals, crinoids, brachiopods,
  trilobites, pelecypods (clams),
  cephalopods, bryozoa, arthropods,
  and others. The youngest fossils are teeth and bones of prehistoric
  bison, giant beavers, deer, mammoths and mastodons
  of the “Ice Age,” and snails found in glacial loess.</p>


  <h2 id="c38"> <span >PLANT FOSSILS <span id="m35">(35)</span></span></h2>
<p>PLANT FOSSILS are the remains of prehistoric plants. Woody
  structures of plants aid preservation just as hard parts of animals
  do. Leaves and plants without much woody material generally
  were well preserved only if they were buried quickly in fine,
  soft sediment.</p>
<p>The most famous Illinois plant fossils are those from the
  Mazon Creek area in Grundy and Will Counties of northeastern
  Illinois. The plant material acted as a nucleus around which iron
  minerals accumulated to form concretions. Many good fossils—of
  trunks, branches, leaves, and seeds—are found in coals and
  in shale directly overlying coals. Descendants of “Coal Measures”
  plants, such as ferns, mosses, and rushes, are still living
  today, but they no longer thrive as they did in the warm, moist
  climate of the Pennsylvanian forests.</p>
<p>Some plants of Pennsylvanian age are petrified, and occasionally
  such trees or stumps are found. Petrified trees are found
  also in the upper Mesozoic deposits of southern Illinois. Fossils
  of “Ice Age” plants closely related to forms living at the present
  time are occasionally found in peat bogs or scattered throughout
  glacial deposits.</p>




<h2 id="c39"> <span >KEYS FOR IDENTIFICATION OF COMMON ILLINOIS ROCKS AND MINERALS</span></h2>
<p>Two keys, one for minerals and one for rocks, briefly present
  clues that may aid the collector in identifying rocks and minerals found
  in Illinois. In outline form, the keys are a guide to some of the easily
  observable properties that various rocks and minerals display.</p>
<p>The rocks and minerals in the school set of “Typical Rocks and
  Minerals of Illinois” are included, plus other relatively common ones
  you might find in Illinois. Because of the great diversity of rocks and
  minerals in this state, the keys are not conclusive. It is therefore suggested
  you consult other more complete keys (such as that in Dana’s
  <i>Manual of Mineralogy</i>) when identifying rocks and minerals that are either
  from other states or are difficult to identify.</p>
<p>The minerals (p. <a href="#Page_30" >30</a>-35) are arranged in two groups: 1) those with
  a metallic luster, and 2) those with a nonmetallic luster. Each group is
  arranged according to increasing hardness. Other characteristics such
  as color, streak, cleavage, fracture, and composition are listed.</p>
<p>The rocks (p. <a href="#Page_36" >36</a>-39) are arranged according to their reaction to
  dilute hydrochloric acid applied to a scratched surface. (The acid reacts
  more readily to powdered material produced by scratching the rock.) After
  the reaction to acid has been determined, the texture and components
  of the rock should be noted. Because rocks grade into one another, clear
  distinctions are not always possible.</p>

<h2>Equipment for Collecting</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Hammer (bricklayer’s) with one chisel or pick head.</li>
  <li>Cold chisel about 6 inches long with an edge about ½-inch
    wide.</li>
  <li>Dilute hydrochloric (muriatic) acid (10 percent solution) in a
    dropper bottle for testing the presence of carbonate minerals.
    Mark the bottle POISON. If acid is spilled on skin or
    clothing, wipe immediately and, if possible, rinse with
    water.</li>
  <li>Magnifying glass or hand lens—10 power is probably most
    useful.</li>
  <li>Hardness testers—penny, square of window glass, pocket
    knife, or nail.</li>
  <li>Streak plate—piece of unglazed white porcelain (such as the
    back of a tile) for testing the color of the streak of minerals.</li>
  <li>Notebook and pencil for keeping records of the locality and
    bed from which specimens are collected.</li>
  <li>Collecting bag—a musette bag, a knapsack, or similar bag
    of strong material.</li>
  <li>Heavy gloves and goggles to protect hands and eyes.</li>
  <li>Labels and wrappings. Field identification of specimens
    may be written on adhesive tape and attached to the specimen
    or on a slip of paper enclosed in the wrapping. Newspaper,
    brown paper, or paper bags can be used for wrapping
    specimens. Label the outside of the wrapped specimen
    too. Take only the best specimens home with you. Trim
    specimens to hand size (about 2 by 3 inches).</li>
</ol>

<p >All specimens should be labeled with the following information:
  name of mineral or rock type, where found, collector’s
  name, and date. As your collection grows, you may want to
  set up a system of cataloging. List specimens and assign a
  number to each one. Place a small amount of white enamel
  on a corner of each specimen; when the enamel dries, number
  the sample with India ink; coat number with lacquer.
  Corresponding numbers should be entered on your list of
  specimens.</p>



<h2 id="c46"> <span >EDUCATIONAL EXTENSION PROGRAM</span></h2>
<p>This book was prepared by the Educational Extension
  Section of the Illinois State Geological Survey, principally
  Betty Jean Hanagan, I. Edgar Odom, and Shirley
  J. Trueblood, under the direction of George M. Wilson.
  They were assisted by other members of the Survey
  staff, especially J. E. Lamar and J. C. Bradbury of the
  Industrial Minerals Section.</p>
<p>Educational Extension also serves the public by assembling
  and distributing rock and mineral collections for
  Illinois educational groups, giving lectures, preparing
  exhibits, answering queries about identification of
  rocks and minerals, reporting Survey news, and conducting
  earth science field trips.</p>
<p>During each year six field trips are conducted in widely
  separated parts of the state for teachers, students,
  and laymen. The general program is especially designed
  to assist in teaching the earth sciences and to
  help make Illinois citizens aware of the state’s great
  mineral wealth.</p>
