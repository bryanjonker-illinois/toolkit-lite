# The toolkit stylesheet

The toolkit stylesheet defines a number of CSS variables that can be helpful when using the toolkit in combination with a custom stylesheet.

The toolkit variables fall into 3 categories:

* [Color variables](./colors/README.md) contain the campus color palette, plus utilities for ensuring that certain color combinations meet accessibility contrast standards.
* [Font variables](./fonts/README.md) provide access to campus typefaces, using files hosted on our fast content delivery network.
* [Icon variables](./icons/README.md) make the campus's library of custom icons available for use in web content.
