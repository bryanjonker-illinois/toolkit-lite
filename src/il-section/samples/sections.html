    <h2>Limestone</h2>
    <p>Limestone outcrops are abundant in Illinois, especially along
      the bluffs of the Mississippi, Ohio, and Illinois Rivers.</p>
    <p>Limestone effervesces freely in dilute hydrochloric acid,
      but dolomite must be powdered before it will effervesce. In nature,
      limestones may be dissolved by percolating water containing
      weak acid (such as carbonic acid, composed of water and
      carbon dioxide). At many places in southern and southwestern
      Illinois such solution of limestones has produced caves and
      caverns.</p>

    <h2>Granite</h2>
    <p>Granite pebbles or boulders are the most common igneous
      rocks found in glacial deposits in Illinois. They are not native
      to the state but were brought here by the great ice sheets or glaciers
      that advanced from southern Canada to cover much of northern
      United States during Pleistocene time.</p>
    <p>Native granitic rock probably lies very deep beneath the entire
      state. It has been found in deep oil-test drillings along the
      western and northern margins of Illinois.</p>

    <h2>Gabbro</h2>
    <p>Gabbro is another intrusive igneous rock, but it is heavier
      and darker than granite. It is composed mainly of feldspar and
      dark iron-bearing minerals that give the rock a dark color. It is
      coarse grained and contains little or no quartz.</p>
    <p>Like other igneous rocks found near the surface in Illinois,
      gabbro was carried into Illinois by the glaciers and deposited as
      glacial debris.</p>
