    <h2>Limestone</h2>
    <p>Limestone outcrops are abundant in Illinois, especially along
      the bluffs of the Mississippi, Ohio, and Illinois Rivers.</p>
    <p>Limestone effervesces freely in dilute hydrochloric acid,
      but dolomite must be powdered before it will effervesce. In nature,
      limestones may be dissolved by percolating water containing
      weak acid (such as carbonic acid, composed of water and
      carbon dioxide). At many places in southern and southwestern
      Illinois such solution of limestones has produced caves and
      caverns.</p>
