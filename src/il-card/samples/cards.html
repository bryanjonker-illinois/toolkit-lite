    <h1>Cards</h1>

    <p class="il-lede">Cards are versatile components that can be combined to create a variety of layouts.</p>

    <p>This is a card placed between paragraphs.</p>

    <il-card>
      <h2>Limestone</h2>
      <p>Limestone outcrops are abundant in Illinois, especially along
        the bluffs of the Mississippi, Ohio, and Illinois Rivers.</p>
      <p>Limestone effervesces freely in dilute hydrochloric acid,
        but dolomite must be powdered before it will effervesce. In nature,
        limestones may be dissolved by percolating water containing
        weak acid (such as carbonic acid, composed of water and
        carbon dioxide). At many places in southern and southwestern
        Illinois such solution of limestones has produced caves and
        caverns.</p>
    </il-card>

    <p>Cards can have different background colors.</p>

    <il-card class="il-blue">
      <h2>Gabbro</h2>
      <p>Gabbro is another intrusive igneous rock, but it is heavier
        and darker than granite. It is composed mainly of feldspar and
        dark iron-bearing minerals that give the rock a dark color. It is
        coarse grained and contains little or no quartz.</p>
      <p>Like other igneous rocks found near the surface in Illinois,
        gabbro was carried into Illinois by the glaciers and deposited as
        glacial debris.</p>
    </il-card>

    <il-card class="il-orange">
      <h2>Granite</h2>
      <p>Granite pebbles or boulders are the most common igneous
        rocks found in glacial deposits in Illinois. They are not native
        to the state but were brought here by the great ice sheets or glaciers
        that advanced from southern Canada to cover much of northern
        United States during Pleistocene time.</p>
      <p>Native granitic rock probably lies very deep beneath the entire
        state. It has been found in deep oil-test drillings along the
        western and northern margins of Illinois.</p>
    </il-card>

    <p>Cards can be arranged in grids</p>


    <il-cards role="list" columns="2">
      <il-card role="listitem">
        <h2>Conglomerate</h2>
        <p>Conglomerate is a sedimentary rock made up of pebbles
          or other rock fragments cemented in a background or matrix of
          finer material, generally
          silica, calcium carbonate,
          clay, iron oxide, or a
          mixture of these substances.
          The rounded
          rock fragments have
          been worn by being
          rolled in streams and
          along beaches.</p>
      </il-card>
      <il-card role="listitem">
        <h2>Quartzite</h2>
        <p>Quartzite is a metamorphic rock that originally was quartz
          sandstone. Quartzites are produced by intense heat and/or
          pressure, probably aided by hot silica-bearing solutions. The
          quartz grains may be so closely interlocked that individual grains
          are no longer recognizable. The rock fractures conchoidally
          through both the grains and cement, so the broken surface, unlike
          that of sandstone, is smooth and may even be glassy like
          quartz.</p>

          a distinctive texture or mineral or indicate composition. For example,
          biotite gneiss emphasizes a mineral, and granite gneiss

        <h2>Sandstone</h2>
        <p>Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock consisting of
          sand-sized grains (one sixty-fourth to one-sixteenth inch in
          diameter) held together by a cementing material. As sandstones
          become finer grained they grade into siltstones; as they become
          coarser grained they grade into conglomerate. The shape of sand
          grains in sandstones ranges from rounded to angular.</p>

        <p>Porphyry is an igneous rock identified by its texture rather

          green, gray, or black color is due to the dark-colored minerals
          that make up much of the rock. The minerals in basalt are fine
          grained and are packed closely together. Phenocrysts of olivine,
          pyroxene, and hornblende may be present. Basalt is easily identified

          or sills (thin sheets) that were formed when molten rock from
          deeper in the earth intruded into cracks and fissures in the bedrock
          of southeastern Illinois (Hardin, Pope, Gallatin, and Saline
          Counties). Peridotite pebbles and boulders also may be found in

        <h2>Gneiss and Schist</h2>
        <p>Gneiss is a metamorphic rock composed of roughly parallel
          bands of minerals. It is medium grained to coarse grained and
          is generally light in color. The names given to gneiss emphasize
          a distinctive texture or mineral or indicate composition. For example,
          biotite gneiss emphasizes a mineral, and granite gneiss
          indicates the composition of the rock.</p>
        <p>Schist is much like gneiss but is fine grained and has a
          thinly layered structure that makes the rock break with a wavy
          surface. Some common types of schistose rocks are talc schist,
          chlorite schist, and hornblende schist. As the names indicate,
          they are characterized by their dominant mineral. Mica schist
          may be formed by the metamorphism of either sedimentary or igneous
          rocks.</p>
        <p>Gneiss and schist are not native to Illinois but are found in
          the glacial drift.</p>

          mixture of these substances.
          The rounded
          rock fragments have
          been worn by being
          rolled in streams and
          along beaches.</p>
        <p>If the pebbles embedded
          in the matrix are sharp and
          angular, freshly broken and not
          worn, the rock is called breccia
          and is generally found near the place where the fragments originated.
          Conglomerate or breccia may be made up of any type of
          rock or mineral, most commonly durable material such as chert,
          quartz, quartzite, granite, and gneiss.</p>
        <p>In Illinois, conglomerates commonly are found at the base of
          sandstone formations and as beds in the lower “Coal Measures.”
          They also are found in some gravel deposits.</p>

        <h2>Sandstone</h2>
        <p>Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock consisting of
          sand-sized grains (one sixty-fourth to one-sixteenth inch in
          diameter) held together by a cementing material. As sandstones
          become finer grained they grade into siltstones; as they become
          coarser grained they grade into conglomerate. The shape of sand
          grains in sandstones ranges from rounded to angular.</p>
        <p>Quartz is the dominant mineral in sandstone, but other rock
          grains and mineral grains (especially chalcedony, feldspar, muscovite,
          hornblende, magnetite, or garnet) generally are present.</p>
        <p>Sandstones are commonly cemented by carbonates, silica,
          iron oxides, or clays. Most sandstones are a shade of gray or
          brown, but the color may vary from gray or white to yellow,
          brown, or red. The color probably depends on the type of cement,
          the amount of organic material present, and the amount and degree
          of oxidation of iron in the rock.</p>
        <p>Durability of sandstones depends largely on the character
          of the cement. Some sandstones crumble easily, but others, especially
          those cemented by iron oxides or silica, are tough and
          durable. Sandstones break around the grains, giving the broken
          surface a granular appearance.</p>
        <p>Sandstone crops out in many places throughout much of the
          state. In LaSalle and Ogle Counties, large tonnages of sand are
          mined from the St. Peter Sandstone and sold for a variety of uses,
          including abrasive sand, molding sand, and sand for making
          glass. In extreme southern Illinois attractively colored sandstones
          have been quarried for building stone.</p>

        <h2>Quartzite</h2>
        <p>Quartzite is a metamorphic rock that originally was quartz
          sandstone. Quartzites are produced by intense heat and/or
          pressure, probably aided by hot silica-bearing solutions. The
          quartz grains may be so closely interlocked that individual grains
          are no longer recognizable. The rock fractures conchoidally
          through both the grains and cement, so the broken surface, unlike
          that of sandstone, is smooth and may even be glassy like
          quartz.</p>
        <p>Color depends upon the amount and kind of impurities present.
          A quartzite that is all quartz is white or gray, but iron or
          other elements may change the color to shades of purple, yellow,
          brown, or red. Quartzite is a very resistant, hard rock and cannot
          be scratched by a knife.</p>
        <p>Quartzite is abundant as boulders and pebbles in glacial
          drift of Illinois, having been brought into the state during the
          “Ice Age.”</p>

      <h2>Shale</h2>
      <p>Shale is a common and important sedimentary rock composed
        of compacted clay or mud. It is so fine grained that the minerals
        forming it generally cannot be identified without the aid of X-ray.</p>
      <p>Shales are composed mainly of clay minerals but, like other
        sedimentary rocks, generally include other minerals. Shales
        containing calcium carbonate are called calcareous shales. Most
        shales contain silt or sand particles; if silt or sand is present
        in large quantity, the rock is called silty shale or sandy shale.
        If mica minerals are present in quantity in a shale it is called
        micaceous shale.</p>
      <p>The particles of most clay minerals are thin and flat and
        overlap each other.</p>
      <p>Shales have a wide range of colors but most of those in Illinois
        are gray. A gray, black, or blue-gray color is caused by
        organic matter in the shale; shades of red, brown, yellow, or
        green are caused by iron compounds.</p>
      <p>Shale is widely distributed in Illinois, especially in “Coal
        Measures” rocks, and is used in manufacturing bricks, drain
        tile, building tile, and lightweight aggregate.</p>

      <h2>Clay</h2>
      <p>Clay is an unconsolidated rock made up of a group of hydrous
        aluminum silicate minerals, of which chlorite, montmorillonite,
        kaolinite, and illite are the most abundant. These minerals
        are formed by the weathering or alteration of other rocks
        and minerals.</p>
      <p>Clays are very fine grained and their minerals have tiny, flat
        crystals that can be distinguished from each other only by laboratory
        methods. Although clays may appear to be similar, their
        compositions vary greatly.</p>
      <p>Some clays are white, but most are colored by iron compounds
        and organic matter. Wet clays have an earthy odor and
        generally are slick and plastic, but dry clays are relatively hard
        and are greasy to the touch.</p>
      <p>Clays are abundant in Illinois, especially in soils, in
        shales, and as clay deposits. In Illinois the underclays that
        occur beneath coal beds are particularly well suited to the manufacture
        of bricks, pottery, stoneware, and drain tile.</p>
