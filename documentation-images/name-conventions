This folder is intended to hold images which will be used in the project documentation. 

The folder scheme will follow the major segments of the documentation so that similar images can be found together. 
As of Oct. 2, the starting folder structure I'm looking at comes from the right nav and includes:

* about-the-toolkit
* usage
* components-reference
* cdn-and-resources
* developers

The name scheme will follow the names of the pages, so a web page named il-accordion will have a file named il-accordion.(something).
