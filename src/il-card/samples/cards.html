    <h1>Cards</h1>

    <p class="il-lede">Cards are versatile components that can be combined to create a variety of layouts.</p>

    <p>This is a card placed between paragraphs.</p>

    <il-card>
      <h2>Limestone</h2>
      <p>Limestone outcrops are abundant in Illinois, especially along
        the bluffs of the Mississippi, Ohio, and Illinois Rivers.</p>
      <p>Limestone effervesces freely in dilute hydrochloric acid,
        but dolomite must be powdered before it will effervesce. In nature,
        limestones may be dissolved by percolating water containing
        weak acid (such as carbonic acid, composed of water and
        carbon dioxide). At many places in southern and southwestern
        Illinois such solution of limestones has produced caves and
        caverns.</p>
    </il-card>

    <p>Cards can have different background colors.</p>

    <il-card class="il-blue">
      <h2>Gabbro</h2>
      <p>Gabbro is another intrusive igneous rock, but it is heavier
        and darker than granite. It is composed mainly of feldspar and
        dark iron-bearing minerals that give the rock a dark color. It is
        coarse grained and contains little or no quartz.</p>
      <p>Like other igneous rocks found near the surface in Illinois,
        gabbro was carried into Illinois by the glaciers and deposited as
        glacial debris.</p>
    </il-card>

    <il-card class="il-orange">
      <h2>Granite</h2>
      <p>Granite pebbles or boulders are the most common igneous
        rocks found in glacial deposits in Illinois. They are not native
        to the state but were brought here by the great ice sheets or glaciers
        that advanced from southern Canada to cover much of northern
        United States during Pleistocene time.</p>
      <p>Native granitic rock probably lies very deep beneath the entire
        state. It has been found in deep oil-test drillings along the
        western and northern margins of Illinois.</p>
    </il-card>

    <p>Cards can be arranged in grids</p>


    <il-cards role="list" columns="2">
      <il-card role="listitem">
        <h2>Conglomerate</h2>
        <p>Conglomerate is a sedimentary rock made up of pebbles
          or other rock fragments cemented in a background or matrix of
          finer material, generally
          silica, calcium carbonate,
          clay, iron oxide, or a
          mixture of these substances.
          The rounded
          rock fragments have
          been worn by being
          rolled in streams and
          along beaches.</p>
      </il-card>
      <il-card role="listitem">
        <h2>Quartzite</h2>
        <p>Quartzite is a metamorphic rock that originally was quartz
          sandstone. Quartzites are produced by intense heat and/or
          pressure, probably aided by hot silica-bearing solutions. The
          quartz grains may be so closely interlocked that individual grains
          are no longer recognizable. The rock fractures conchoidally
          through both the grains and cement, so the broken surface, unlike
          that of sandstone, is smooth and may even be glassy like
          quartz.</p>

    <il-cards role="list" columns="3">
      <il-card role="listitem">
        <h2>Gneiss</h2>
        <p>Gneiss is a metamorphic rock composed of roughly parallel
          bands of minerals. It is medium grained to coarse grained and
          is generally light in color. The names given to gneiss emphasize
          a distinctive texture or mineral or indicate composition. For example,
          biotite gneiss emphasizes a mineral, and granite gneiss
          indicates the composition of the rock.</p>
      </il-card>
      <il-card role="listitem">
        <h2>Sandstone</h2>
        <p>Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock consisting of
          sand-sized grains (one sixty-fourth to one-sixteenth inch in
          diameter) held together by a cementing material. As sandstones
          become finer grained they grade into siltstones; as they become
          coarser grained they grade into conglomerate. The shape of sand
          grains in sandstones ranges from rounded to angular.</p>
