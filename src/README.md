# Component reference

The toolkit consists of custom components that can be used on any web page like other HTML elements.

## Content components

These components represent distinct, specialized pieces of content.

* [Calls to action](./il-call-to-action/README.md) invite users to perform a specific action, like start an application or create an email.
* [Quotes](./il-quote/README.md) are short, meaningful pieces of text that are attributed to a person, publication, or other source. 
* [Statistics](./il-statistic/README.md) call attention to important numbers, like rankings and percentages.

## Container components

These components group multiple pieces of content and offer different methods of browsing them.

* [Accordions](./il-accordion/README.md) present content in a vertical column whose sections can be collapsed and expanded.
* [Carousels](./il-carousel/README.md) arrange content in an endless rotation which can be paused, advanced, and rewound.
* [Tabs](./il-tabs/README.md) present content as layers, each with a visible tab that is used to select the visible layer.

## Layout components

These components create web pages and arrange content inside them.

* [Pages](./il-page/README.md) wrap the content for complete web pages, with areas for the header, footer, and other layout elements.
* [Sections](./il-section/README.md) group distinct portions of the page, each of which may have a specialized presentation.
* [Grids](./il-grid/README.md) arrange pieces of content into rows and columns, left to right and top to bottom.
* [Columns](./il-columns/README.md) break up content into newspaper-style columns.

## Top-of-page components

These components help orient users to the page.

* [The campus header](./il-header/README.md) lets the user know where they are and contains resources like the main navigation and the search form.
* [Heroes](./il-hero/README.md) use large, interesting images to introduce the page.
* [Page titles](./il-page-title/README.md) precede any page content, with optional areas for elements like breadcrumbs and bylines.

## Bottom-of-page-components

These components aid visitors who have reached the end of the page content.

* [The campus footer](./il-footer/README.md) contains contact information for the site and links to important resources within the site and on campus.
* [Back to top](./il-back-to-top/README.md) scrolls users to the beginning of the current page.

## Navigation components

These components contains links that direct the visitor to specific pages on the site.

* The [main navigation](./il-main-nav/README.md) contains the primary collection of links. It is located in the page header and does not change from page to page.
* The [sidebar navigation](./il-sidebar-nav/README.md) appears next to the page content and may change from section to section.
* [Breadcrumbs](./il-breadcrumbs/README.md)
* [Pagination](./il-pagination/README.md)
* [Social navigation](il-social-icons/README.md)
