  description: The contents of this component are contained in a navigation landmark and arranged in lists. Lists can be nested to reflect the site hierarchy.
  
- criteria: 1.4.1
  description: Wherever color is used to differentiate between navigation levels or link states, there is a minimum contrast ratio of 3:1 between different colors. Shifts in position and/or indentation are used as additional indicators of navigation level.
  
- criteria: 1.4.3
  description: There is a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 between the label of a navigation item and its background.
  
- criteria: 1.4.10
  description: The navigation reduces to a single column of items on smaller screens, eliminating the need for horizontal scrolling.
  
- criteria: 1.4.11
  description: The icon that indicates the state of an expandable navigation item uses the same foreground and background colors as the item label, ensuring that the icon meets the minimum contrast ratio for text.

    Expandable navigation items do not change state in response to hover and focus events. A click event (mouse click or Space/Enter keypress) is required to toggle the item.
  
    Clicking on a target outside the navigation will close any open dropdowns. Pressing Esc will close any open dropdowns and return focus to a top-level menu item.

    The following keyboard commands are meaningful when focus is within this component:

      * `Tab` moves focus forward to the closest next focusable element in the navigation or to the closest next focusable element following the navigation.
      * `Shift+Tab` moves focus backward to the closest previous focusable element in the navigation or to the closest previous focusable element preceding the navigation.
      * `Space` and `Enter` activate a navigation item exactly as if they were clicked.
      * `Esc` closes any expanded navigation section and returns focus to the closest top-level item.
  
    Arrow navigation is not currently supported at this time.

  description: Pressing `Esc` while focus is within the component closes any expanded sections and returns focus to the top-level navigation items.

- criteria: 2.4.3
  description: |
    Focus order is dictated by the source code order, following the links in the underlying list from first to last, skipping any focusable elements hidden within collapsed navigation sections.
  
    For expanded navigation sections, the focus order proceeds from the section toggle to the first item in the expanded section. For expanded sections with both a link and a toggle, focus order proceeds from the link to the toggle, then to the first item in the section.

    This component utilizes the following ARIA features:
    
      * The toggle button for expandable sections use the `aria-controls` attribute with a value equal to the `id` of the section contents.
        The toggle button also uses the `aria-expanded` attribute, with a value of `true` or `false` depending on the visibility of the section contents.
      * The recommended usage includes placing `aria-current="page"` on the navigation link that represents the current page.
      * When a navigation item is selected, any existing `aria-current="page"` attribute is removed from the navigation links and `aria-current="page"` is added to the newly selected link.
