# Icon

This component is used to insert icons from [the official campus icon library](../../css/icons/README.md).

```html
<il-icon>home</il-icon>
```

There are two icon families: solid (default) and line. You can use a CSS class to select the correct family.

```html
<il-icon class="il-icon-line">home</il-icon>
```

The following components use icons prominently:
